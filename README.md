Exploring train data

I'm going to play about with National rail datasets and see what I can uncover

Aim 1 - can I show hiw many trains arrived "on time" due to intermediate stations being skipped and what that would do to reliability

Aim 2 - similar to above but within 30 mins of arrival time ie avoiding dekay repay claims for terminal stations

DataData source National rail APIs http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/100296.aspx
Historic service performance API looks like best bet
